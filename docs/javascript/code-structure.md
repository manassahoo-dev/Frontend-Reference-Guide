# Code Structure

## Statements

- Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
- We can have as many statements in our code as we want.
- Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

## Semicolons

## Comments

- One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.

```js
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
```

- Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /_ and end with an asterisk and a forward slash _/.
```js
/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```
